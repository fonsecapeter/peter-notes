.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes the \fBpeter\-notes\fR tool\. This simple ruby gem is an awesome way to manage personal notes from the terminal\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
These options provide some extra utility beyond simply opening notes for editing\.
.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-search <REGEX>\fR
Search within notes for text matching the specified \fBREGEX\fR\. If you havent guessed, this is the grep \fIhttp://linuxcommand\.org/man_pages/grep1\.html\fR part\. Specifically, its running \fBgrep \-r YOUR\-NOTES\-DIR \-e REGEX\fR\.
.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-find <FILE\-GLOB>\fR
Seach for notes that match the specified file\-glob\. This ones running find \fIhttp://linuxcommand\.org/man_pages/find1\.html\fR \-\- \fBfind YOUR\-NOTES\-DIR \-name FILE\-GLOB\fR\. Its a little more than that though, this will be fuzzy in that you can add some path info to your glob\. For example, if you ran \fBnotes \-\-find "projects/*\.txt"\fR, youd get back both \fBprojects/python/jarbs\.txt\fR and \fBprojects/ruby/peter_notes\.txt\fR\. So its better than just find\. A little\.
.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list [<PATH>]\fR
List all notes or, if a \fBPATH\fR is specified, list notes within the specified path\. Bet you thought this was running \fBls \-r\fR, well its actually running tree \fIhttp://linuxcommand\.org/man_pages/tree1\.html\fR because its much cooler \-\- \fBtree YOUR\-NOTES\-DIR/PATH\fR\.
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
\fBnotes\fR\. Yeah\.
.
.P
But you can do more!
.

Lets assume you have the following notes:

.nf

/Users/peter/Notes/
|\-\- projects
|   |\-\- python
|   |   +\-\- jarbs\.txt
|   +\-\- ruby

+\-\- other
    +\-\- motorcycle\.txt

Most of the time you just want to open them\. To do that, just type \fBnotes\fR\. You can specify your text editor and where your notes are in \fB~/peter\-notes\.yaml\fR (see the preferences section below)\.
.
.P
If you want to open a specific note, you can pass in a \fBfile\-glob\fR to specify which notes you want to open\. If you think a file glob is what happens when you spill coffee on your computer, just check this out this \fIhttp://tldp\.org/LDP/abs/html/globbingref\.html\fR or google it (hint, you use it in bash a lot, like, when you \fBls *\.rb\fR)\.
.
.P
If you just want to open \fBother/motorcycle\.txt\fR you can run \fBnotes "other/motorcycle\.txt"\fR\. But thats kind of lame, so you could also fo \fBnotes "motorcycle\.txt"\fR, or even \fBnotes "moto*"\fR\. If youre feeling extra crazy, you could even get away with \fBm*\fR in this case, basically if you pass a glob in, \fBpeter\-notes\fR will just take the first match in \fB\-\-find\fR (see below) and open that\.
.
.P
If you wanted to open all notes under \fBprojects/\fR you could also use this same idea and run \fBnotes "projects"\fR\.
.
.P
Thats like what 90% of what youll ever need and no crazy macros or flags to memorize\. Not bad right? Well not all flags are bad, in fact, you also get some super\-helpful optional ones for the other 10%, just look above at the OPTIONS section\.
.
.P
Oh yeah, make sure your terminal has \fBgrep\fR, \fBfind\fR, and \fBtree\fR\. It should, but depends on how crazy your \'gear\' is\.
.
.SH "PREFERENCES"
Preferences are saved in \'~/\.peter\-notes\.yml\'\. There are just 2 options that you can set:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

editor:
    The editor of your choice\. This value will get passed to bash so
    make sure you use the exact name your terminal will understand\.
    Possible Values: [\'vim\', \'subl\', \'atom\', \'emacs\', \'nano\']
                     (more?) I haven\'t tested others and dont know
                     which work well when opening a directory\. For
                     vim I use the NerdTree plugin\.
    Default Value: \'vim\'

notes_dir:
    The home of your notes\. This is where `peter\-notes` will look
    for them\.
    Possible Values: any valid + existing dorectory path\. I use
                     \'~/GoogleDrive/Notes\' because I track mine in
                     google drive (OverGrive for linux)\.
    Default Value: \'~/Notes\'

That\'s yaml \fIhttp://www\.yaml\.org/start\.html\fR so it should look like this:

This tool runs on top of a few very useful bash utilities and relies on terminal\-accessible text\-editors\. It was also written in a fantastic language called ruby\.
