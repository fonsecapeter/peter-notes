.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes the \fBpeter\-notes\fR tool\. This simple ruby gem is an awesome way to manage personal notes from the terminal\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
These options provide some extra utility beyond simply opening notes for editing\.
.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-search\fR=\fIregex\fR
Search within notes for text matching the supplied regex\.
.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-find=<file\-glob>\fR
Seach for notes that match the supplied bash\-style file glob\.
.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list=[<path>]\fR
List all notes or, if a \fB<path>\fR is supplied, list notes within the supplied path
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
For these examples, lets assume you have the following notes:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

/Users/peter/Notes/
|\-\- projects
|   |\-\- jarbs\.txt
|   +\-\- peter_notes\.txt
+\-\- other
    +\-\- motorcycle\.txt
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
The most common use is to simply open your notes\. To do this, just run \fBnotes\fR with no arguments or options to open them all\.
.
.P
If you want to open a single note, you can pass in a \fBfile\-glob\fR to specify which notes you want to open\. To open just \fBmotorcycle\.txt\fR you can run \fBnotes motorcycle\.txt\fR, or \fBnotes other/motorcycle\.txt\fR, or even \fBnotes motorcycle*\fR\.
.
.P
If you wanted to open all notes under \fBprojects/\fR you could also use this same idea and run \fBnotes projects\fR\.
.
.SH "PREFERENCES"
Preferences are saved in \'~/\.peter\-notes\.yml\'\. There are just 2 options that you can set:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

editor:
    The editor of your choice\. This value will get passed to bash so
    make sure you use the exact name your terminal will understand\.
    Possible Values: [\'vim\', \'subl\', \'atom\', \'emacs\', \'nano\']
                     (more?) I haven\'t tested others and dont know
                     which work well when opening a directory\. For
                     vim I use the NerdTree plugin\.
    Default Value: \'vim\'

notes_dir:
    The home of your notes\. This is where `peter\-notes` will look
    for them\.
    Possible Values: any valid + existing dorectory path\. I use
                     \'~/GoogleDrive/Notes\' because I track mine in
                     google drive (OverGrive for linux)\.
    Default Value: \'~/Notes\'
